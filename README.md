# FoundationDbNet
A driver / client / binding for accessing FoundationDB from .NET applications.

At this time I do not recommend using this to access production FoundationDB instances, or use this library in production situations.

## Requirements

You will need the FoundationDB C client library to use, or test this library.
On Windows you can simply run the build.bat in the repository root which will handle this automatically for you.
