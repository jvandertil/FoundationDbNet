# FoundationDbNet
A driver / client / binding for accessing FoundationDB from .NET applications.

At this time I do not recommend using this to access production FoundationDB instances, or use this library in production situations.

## Requirements

You will need the FoundationDB C client library to use, or test this library.
Run the Retrieve-NativeFdb.ps1 script to retrieve the binary drivers from the FoundationDB website.
